* Front-End Repo: https://github.com/natalynyu/healerschoice-client

* Deployed Front End: https://natalynyu.github.io/healerschoice-client/

* Deployed Back End: https://roomresapi.herokuapp.com/

Technologies Used: Ruby and Ruby on Rails

Unsolved Problems for Future Iterations:
* Creating a dropdown for machines instead of letting users type in the machine name
* Prevent users from making reservations 1 year in advance
* Improve styling using Bootstrap

Planning Process & Problem Solving Strategy:
* Reviewed requirements of project and discuss project idea with instructor
* Mapped out wireframes, user stories, and ERD
* Set up front-end and back-end repositories and deployed each of them
* Kept a list of small features that need to be created and fixed and worked on each part step by step instead of tackling the problem all at once
* Testing code frequently to identify bugs early on
* Used curl scripts to test API
* Debugged using console error messages and researching error messages online using sources like StackOverflow
* Requested peers to test my code to identify any remaining issues or missing features
